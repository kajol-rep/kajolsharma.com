        <p>
            Running dinosaur is one of the popular game which is available in your chrome web browser.
            If you have not discovered it yet or maybe you saw the dinosaur but didn't think of it as a game, 
            then I think - surprise.. It is also called as a hidden dinosaur game because it can be played without internet in your chrome web browser. You just have to jump over and avoid whatever comes your way like the bushes and birds to get more scores and win.
            I will share some amazing tricks for playing this game.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Did you know?</h2>
        <p>
            If you do not want to interrupt your internet and want to play when online, then congratulations.
            Just type chrome://dino in your address bar, as shown above, and the “No internet” screen will open, then press [space] to play the game.
        <br>

            Have you ever done hacking or used cheat codes in your game?
            If yes then you will know what hacking actually means.
            If not! then let me tell you that hacking a game and using cheat codes in a game are two very different thing.

        </p>
        <h2>Cheats VS Hacks</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="color:#059669 ;"><strong>Cheat codes</strong></span> are actually already coded into the game and it's actually a feature included in the game's design nowadays. Lots of online websites are providing cheats codes. Cheat codes can alter a game, but not the game program.
             It's just performing a behaviour that it was always capable of without modification.  
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:#059669 ;"><strong>Hacking</strong></span> is altering an existing system to behave in a different way. It is not as easy as cheating. It requires lot of coding skills and techniques to access areas of server you weren't meant to access.
        </p>
        <h2>Lets get started</h2>
        <p>
            It is easy and simple, you just have to follow the navgation after right click on the game page then go to -
            <br>inspect --> console<br>
            A window will open as demonstrated below. 
        </p>
        <img class="blog-img" src="/images/dino_inspect.png"/>
        <p>
            Type the following command in your console panel. 
            <br><br>
            <span style="background-color: yellow;">Runner.instance_.playingIntro = true;</span>
            <br>
            This will make all the obstacles disappear.
            <br><br>
            <span style="background-color: yellow;">Runner.instance_.playingIntro = false;</span>
            <br>
            This will make all the obstacles enabled back on the screen. 
            <br><br>
            <span style="background-color: yellow;">Runner.instance_.gameOver=function(){};</span>
            <br>
            Now your dinosaur will not stop even if it hits the obstacle and you can score the highest among your friends.
            <br><br>
            <span style="background-color: yellow;">Runner.instance_.setSpeed(100);</span>
            <br>
            You can control the speed using this command.
            <br><br>
            So, these were the few things which you can do and play with the code available on chrome.
            This looks like hacking because of code alerting but it is not.
            The code is available by chrome so that you can play with the code and learn from it.
            Also, please note that once you refresh it will come back to its original state.
            Enjoy playing!
